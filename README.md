## 🚀 Professional Overview
I grew up surrounded by electricity—both of my parents worked for a power distribution company, and my childhood home was right next to a substation. That environment ignited my curiosity early. By the age of eight, I was already dismantling my electronic toys to understand how they worked.  

That curiosity shaped my academic and professional path. During my bachelor’s, I started with Arduino projects, competing in robotics and automation challenges. Later, I switched to Raspberry Pi for more computing power, completing my final BSc project with Python. When I began my master’s, I realized that industrial control systems demand robustness beyond hobbyist platforms. This discovery led me to PLC programming, where I quickly adapted and built strong expertise.  

Today, I bring together my foundation in **automation, control, and energy systems** with hands-on skills in **PLCs, MATLAB/Simulink, and Python/AI**, designing smarter, reliable, and future-focused engineering solutions. Outside of engineering, I enjoy traveling, biking, and occasionally gaming when indoors.
